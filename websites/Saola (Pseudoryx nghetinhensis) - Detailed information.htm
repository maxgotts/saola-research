	The saola is one of the most recently discovered large mammals, and its formal
	description elicited an incredible flurry of scientific interest due to its
	highly distinctive physical traits. In fact, the saola is so distinctive
	that its discovery required the creation of a new genus (<i>Pseudoryx</i>).
	Initial attempts at classifying <i>Pseudoryx</i> within the ungulates were
	all over the map: based on morphological characters, various authors allied
	the saola with the subfamily
	<a href="http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Bovinae.html">Bovinae</a> (including it in each
	of the three tribes: Boselaphini (nilgai and chousingha), Bovini (cattle
	and buffalo), and Tragelaphini (spiral-horned antelope)) or with the subfamily
	<a href="http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Caprinae.html">Caprinae</a> (specifically the
	Rupicaprini, closest to serows and gorals) (Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995).
	Genetic analysis (based on mitochondrial DNA and rRNA genes) by Hassanin
	and Douzery (1999) has shown that <i>Pseudoryx</i> is strongly nested within
	the subfamily <a href="http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Bovinae.html">Bovinae</a>. While
	these authors suggest that the saola should be placed within the tribe Bovini,
	the current consensus is to place <i>Pseudoryx</i> in its own tribe -
	Pseudorygini (Hernandez-Fernandez and Vrba, 2005).

	Few measurements have been made from live saolas. Weight is approximately
	100 kg, body length around 150 cm, and shoulder height between 80 and 90

	The general color of the saola is a deep chestnut brown, with individuals
	varying from a rich reddish brown to almost black (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993;
	Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995). The hair on the upper parts is short (1.5-2.5
	cm long), fine, and glossy - the head and neck have especially short hairs
	(Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Robichaud, 1998). Considering the cool, damp weather
	in at least part of its range, the coat of the saola is surprisingly soft
	and thin (Robichaud, 1998). The underparts are also brown, but are paler
	than the upper body, and are covered in fluffy, almost wooly hairs about
	3.5 cm in length (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Robichaud, 1998). The anal area
	and inner flanks (including the scrotal skin of males) is white (Dung <i>et
	al.</i>, 1993). The same pale coloration of the underparts is seen on the
	neck (beginning from the shoulders), and this appears as a conspicuous patch
	when seen from the side (Robichaud, 1998). There is no dorsal crest, but
	a thin (0.5 cm wide) black stripe runs along the spine from between the shoulders
	to the top of the tail, where it fades out (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Robichaud,
	1998). A white horizontal stripe runs across the rump, and is matched by
	a white band across the tail which merges with the stripe when in a relaxed
	position (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Robichaud, 1998). This stripe splits
	the tail into three bands of color - brown at the base, white in the middle,
	and black towards the fluffy terminal tassel (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993;
	Robichaud, 1998). The legs are darker than the main body, accented by two
	white spots above the hooves which are separated by a fine band of black
	(Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995).
	<p>
	The form of the saola is similar to that of other forest-dwelling ungulates
	such as duikers
	(<a href="http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Cephalophinae.html">Cephalophinae</a>), with
	a compact body and hunched back adapted for moving through dense cover (Schaller
	and Rabinowitz, 1995). The hunched posture causes the shoulders to sit low
	in comparison to the arch of the spine - an adult female examined by Robichaud
	(1998) had a shoulder height of 84 cm but a height of 96 cm at the tallest
	part of the back. The skin is 1-2 mm thick over most of the body, but thickens
	significantly (to around 5 mm thick) on the nape of the neck and shoulders
	(Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995). Schaller and Rabinowitz suggest this thick
	skin may act as a shield to protect saola from being punctured by a rival's
	horn during intraspecific conflict (Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995). There
	are no known glands on the legs (Robichaud, 1998). The dark grey hooves are
	approximately 6 cm in length and have rounded tips, resembling those of the
	<a href="http://www.ultimateungulate.com/artiodactyla/Bubalus_depressicornis.html">lowland anoa (<i>Bubalus
	depressicornis</i>)</a> (Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995). The dew claws are
	vestigial calluses (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993). Females have four nipples
	(Robichaud, 1998).
	</p><p>
	The head is described as "delicately shaped" by Schaller and Rabinowitz (1995),
	with a narrow muzzle and distinctly arched nasal bones which give the appearance
	of an almost bulging face (see also Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993). The ears are
	relatively small (each being about 10 cm long); they are brown behind, whitish
	inside, and are covered with short hair except for a long tuft on the inner
	surface (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993). The eyes have dark brown irises and round
	pupils, and in a flashlight beam they reflect a glowing orange (Robichaud,
	1998). The rhinarium (naked flesh of the nose) is dark brown, and the tongue
	is unusually long - it can extend up to 16 cm to reach the eyes and upper
	face (Robichaud, 1998). The lips are white, as is the underside of the chin
	and upper throat (Robichaud, 1998). On the underside of the muzzle is a cluster
	of whiskers about 2 cm long (Robichaud, 1998). The faces of both males and
	females are distinctly marked with white to buff patches, the most distinctive
	of which is a long, thin stripe above each eye (forming an "eyebrow") (Dung
	<i>et al.</i>, 1993). A variable pattern of spots and slashes runs from beneath
	the eye to under the jaw, while a single white spot may be present on the
	cheek (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993). On close examination, Robichaud (1998)
	found each white cheek mark to conceal dermal nodules 1 to 2 mm high, which
	were found nowhere else on the face; black whiskers 2.0-2.5 cm long protrude
	from most of these nodules, and the presence of a single pore at their apex
	may indicate a secretory function.
	</p><p>
	The maxillary glands, located just in front of the eye, are extremely
	well-developed (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1994) - indeed,
	Robichaud (1998) suggests that the saola may have the largest
	maxillary-preorbital gland of any extant mammalian species. Robichaud (1998)
	provides a detailed description of the maxillary gland and its secretion:
	the fleshy external part of the gland comprises a rectangular, shallow depression
	along the upper muzzle measuring approximately 9 cm long by 3.5 cm wide by
	1.5 cm deep. The gland secretes a thick, grayish-green paste with a foul,
	pungent odor reminiscent of the musk of mustelids. This depression is covered
	by a muscular flap (0.8 cm thick) which can be raised like an awning to expose
	the gland. This unusual flap of skin has been misinterpreted in popular media,
	and the saola is sometimes referred to as an antelope with "gills".
	</p><p>
	Many detailed descriptions of the horns of the saola exist: they are the
	most frequently encountered evidence of this species. In adults, the two
	horns are long, slender, and nearly straight, with a slight curve backwards
	(Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995). The horns are
	swept backwards following the profile of the face, and rest on the back when
	the head is tilted upwards (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1994). They range from nearly
	parallel to moderately diverging - villagers have even reported one individual
	with crossed horn tips - but there does not appear to be a significant difference
	in divergence between males and females as initially reported by Dung <i>et
	al.</i> (1993 - Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995). In cross-section the horns
	are round to oval, and there is no keel on either the horn cores or the outer
	sheaths (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995; Robichaud,
	1998). For the majority of their length the horns are smooth, although
	corrugations are often found within a few centimeters of the base (7 cm according
	to Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993; 2-4 cm from Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995).
	The lateral and medial surfaces of horns of many individuals are rough and
	pitted, and it has been suggested that the smoothness of the horn sheath
	is the result of animals sharpening their horns by rubbing them against small
	trees (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Robichaud, 1998). The horn cores extend
	close to the horn tips (over 80% of the horn length in both specimens measured
	by Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995), and suggest that they serve a real fighting
	purpose, possibly as defence against predators (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993;
	Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1994).
	</p><p>
	The horns of most adults of both sexes are 35-50 cm long, with the longest
	reported set having a maximum length of 52 cm (Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995).
	In Laos, eight sets of adult horns examined by Schaller and Rabinowitz (1995)
	had a length of 36.2-50.4 cm, averaging 44.2 cm. Eighteen sets of horns measured
	by Dung <i>et al.</i> (1993) varied in length from 32-52 cm, with an average
	of 41 cm. Due to the difference in horn divergence among individuals, the
	width between the horn tips shows considerable variation. Dung <i>et al.</i>
	(1993) reported horn tip distances of 7.5-20 cm, with an average of 13.3
	cm (n=17), while skulls examined by Schaller and Rabinowitz (1995) measured
	between 3.5 and 18.4 cm between the horn tips (average 9.6 cm, n=7). The
	living female observed by Robichaud (1998) did not follow this trend - the
	distance between the tips of her horns was 25 cm. The basal circumference
	shows much less variation among individuals, ranging from 10.8 to 13.0 cm
	(average 11.7 cm, n=8) (Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995).

      <div class="indent">
	Given its recent discovery, the remoteness of its range, and a minimal number
	of scientific observations, a surprising amount of information on the
	reproductive cycle of <i>P. nghetinhensis</i> has been gathered and inferred.
	Most of the data is from a single pregnant female observed in life by Robichaud
	(1998, in central Laos) that was found to be carrying a male fetus upon her
	death in January 1996. Based on the size of the fetus (38 cm from nose to
	rump along the contour of the spine) and weight (800-1,000 grams), the pregnancy
	was estimated to be in its second trimester. By inferring a 33 week gestation
	length from similarly-sized spiral-horned antelope (the nyala <i>Tragelaphus
	angasii</i> and sitatunga <i>Tragelaphus spekii</i>), Robichaud (1998) estimated
	that the fetus would have been conceived between late August and mid-November
	(the mid-rainy to early dry season in Laos). Likewise, the birth would be
	expected to occur between mid-April and late June (the late dry season to
	mid wet season), an estimate which is supported by observations made by Schaller
	and Rabinowitz (1995). The timing of wet and dry seasons is different in
	Vietnam, and thus the seasonality of the saola's reproductive seasons may
	be different there. Based on horn length variation among animals within the
	same cohort, Schaller and Rabinowitz (1995) suggested that the birthing season
	spreads over 2 to 3 months. All of the data collected to date suggests that
	the saola is a seasonal breeder, with births timed to coincide with the onset
	of the monsoon (Robichaud, 1998). No estimate of life expectancy is available,
	but the adult female examined by Robichaud (1998) was estimated to be between
	8 or 9 years old.

      <div class="indent">
	<i>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</i> inhabits forested habitats in the Annamite
	mountains without a pronounced dry season (i.e., some rain falls in nearly
	every month) (Robichaud and Timmins, 2004). Most saola records are from
	climatically wet broadleaf evergreen forests at mid-elevation (generally
	at 400-800 m above sea level, sometimes up to 200 m above or below this),
	often dominated by the dipterocarp <i>Hopea mollissima</i> (Dung <i>et al.</i>,
	1993; Robichaud and Timmins, 2004). Forest blocks smaller than 25 square
	kilometers are not used (Timmins <i>et al.</i>, 2008). At higher elevations,
	the forests are dominated by conifers - notably <i>Fokenia hodgsoni</i> -
	but, while the mountains peak at 2,200 m above sea level, there is no evidence
	that this species is found above 1,200 m (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993; Timmins
	<i>et al.</i>, 2008). 
	<p>
	Dung <i>et al.</i> (1993) report that the saola uses all forest levels in
	differing seasons, even entering secondary lowland forests along large rivers
	with an altitude of only 200 m (see also Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995).
	These authors suggest that these seasonal movements are dependent on water,
	with the saola inhabiting higher elevation during the summer months when
	highland streams have plenty of water, and retreating to lower elevations
	in the winter when the same streams dry up. Most hunted specimens have been
	taken in winter, when saola are in more accessible lowland terrain (Dung
	<i>et al.</i>, 1994). Even so, most sightings made by locals occur in steep
	- but not precipitous - hills, usually in forest with a closed canopy of
	evergreen broad-leaved trees and an understory with saplings, bamboo, and
	palms (Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995). <i>Pseudoryx</i> is reportedly very
	shy, and never enters agricultural lands (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1994).
	</p><p>
	<i>Pseudoryx</i> is surprisingly tame in the presence of humans - an observation
	made from captive individuals as well as local reports (Robichaud, 1998).
	Predators of the saola potentially include leopard (<i>Panthera pardus</i>)
	and tiger (<i>Panthera tigris</i>), while the defensive stance (described
	below) is similar to that used by other ungulates in the region when preyed
	upon by dhole (<i>Cuon alpinus</i>) (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Schaller and
	Rabinowitz, 1995).
	</p><p>
	Villagers' reports suggest <i>P. nghetinhensis</i> feeds on the leaves of
	fig trees and other riverside bushes; the relatively short incisors suggest
	a browsing diet, supporting this theory (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1994). Local
	reports suggest that the saola is quite fond of the medicinal herb
	<i>Homalomena aromatica</i> (Araceae) (Dung et al., 1994). The saola is a
	rather delicate feeder - the captive female observed by Robichaud (1998)
	rarely jerked or pulled on vegetation while feeding, but rather chewed the
	petioles to separate the leaves from the stem before chewing the leaves
	themselves. This saola only occasionally pulled leaves into mouth using her
	tongue (surprising, given its length and mobility). This captive individual
	was fed <i>Homalomena</i> sp. (Araceae - later identified as the related
	species <i>Schismatoglottis cochinchinensis</i> (Araceae)), <i>Asplenium</i>
	sp. (Aspleniaceae), and an unidentified broad-leaved plant of the family
	Sterculiaceae, all of which are reported to be part of the diet in the wild
	(Robichaud, 1998; Robichaud, 1999).
	</p><p>
	Fecal deposits are composed of boluses (around eight deposited per episode),
	each measuring about 7.5 cm long by 4.5-6.0 cm in diameter. Each bolus is
	formed of smaller oval-shaped pellets (each about 1 cm by 2 cm by 0.75 cm
	- one bolus examined contained 46 pellets) (Robichaud, 1998). Boluses of
	fresh dung were eaten on one observed occasion (Robichaud, 1998). Observations
	of the drinking habits of the saola suggest that they can consumed large
	quantities of water at one time - in one 4 minute span, the captive female
	observed by Robichaud (1998) took nearly 60 draughts of water, pausing only
	five times to lick her nose and muzzle.

	<a name="Behavior">Behavior</a>

      <div class="indent">
	<i>P. nghetinhensis</i> appears to be a solitary species based on reports
	collected from locals by Schaller and Rabinowitz (1995). Adult pairs (male
	and female) are known, but the majority of pairs seem to be a female with
	her most recent offspring (Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995). Dung <i>et al.
	</i>(1994) reported that the saola travels in small groups of two or three
	animals, rarely as large as six or seven.
	<p>
	The captive individual studied by Robichaud (1998) is the source of the majority
	of behavioral data on this species. Except where noted, all following data
	comes from this paper.
	</p><p>
	The captive saola was primarily diurnal, or diurnal and crepuscular, although
	the author noted a potential bias due to day-time human activity. Nonetheless,
	this individual fed at most times during the day and only rarely at night,
	and was observed to rest her chin on the ground with eyes closed most frequently
	during the hours of darkness. Rumination occurred most frequently in the
	morning. Interviews with Laotian locals indicate that this species is most
	active during the morning, late afternoon, and at night, but not when the
	sun is overhead - although camera traps have photographed active saola in
	midday (the daytime camera-trap image above was taken at 11h50; Robichaud,
	1999). While resting, the forelegs are tucked under the body.
	</p><p>
	While relatively placid with people, dogs provoke a strong defensive reaction
	in this species: when faced with dogs, saola will turn to face the threat,
	arch the back by bringing all feet together and bow the head such that the
	tips of the horns point at the dogs. In the captive female observed by Robichaud,
	the maxillary glands were flared during such posturing, accompanied by snorting.
	When chased by dogs in the wild, saola are said to run to the nearest stream
	where they make their stand (Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995).
	</p><p>
	Grooming with the tongue appears to be a significant activity, the main function
	of which (in the captive animal) was to disperse gathering flies. The eyes
	and face were licked the most, followed by the flanks, shoulders, and forelegs.
	Licking of the muzzle was also observed after feeding, drinking, and ruminating.
	Scent-marking was observed five times: in each instance the flap of the facial
	gland was raised and the inner portion of the flap touched to protruding
	rocks around the enclosure. The only known vocalization is a soft, monotone
	bleat, around one second in duration.
	</p><p>
	The postures utilized for urination and defecation were very similar, both
	of which involved squatting with the rear legs spread wide and the rump low
	to the ground. This squatting posture was sometimes held for 0.5-3 minutes
	before and after passing urine or feces (as is typical of bovids, passing
	of urine and feces were performed separately).

      <div class="indent">
	The saola is found in the forests along the Annamite mountain range on the
	border between Viet Nam and Lao People's Democratic Republic. Most
	scientifically-documented records of occurrence are from south of the Song
	Ca river in Viet Nam, although there is a small population which has been
	found north of the river (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Kemp <i>et al.</i>, 1997).
	Within Lao People's Democratic Republic, the saola is known from the provinces
	of Bolikhamxay, Khammouan, Savannakhet and Xekong, and likely lives in southern
	Xieng Khouang Province; in Viet Nam, the provinces of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang
	Binh, Quang Tri, Thua-Thien Hue and Quang Nam support populations of
	<i>Pseudoryx</i> (Timmins <i>et al.</i>, 2008). In all, the total known range
	of the saola encompasses only 4,000 square kilometers, although the historical
	range may include as much as 15,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1994;

      <div class="indent">
	<i>P. nghetinhensis</i> is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN
	(Timmins <i>et al.</i>, 2008), and has been listed on CITES Appendix I since
	November 1994 (Editor's note in Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995; CITES, 2009).
	"A few hundred" individuals were estimated to survive in both Viet Nam and
	Laos in 1995, but proper censusing is difficult due to the remoteness and
	ruggedness of the species' habitat (Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995). The IUCN
	Saola Working Group estimates (as of 2009) probably no more than a few hundred
	saola remain, and possibly as few as a few tens (Saola Working Group, 2009).
	Available data indicate that the saola continues to decline significantly
	in numbers - at the dangerous level of over 80% over the course of three
	generations (estimated for past, present, and future by Timmins <i>et al.</i>,
	2008).
	<p>
	Hunting is the greatest threat to the survival of this species: hunting pressures
	from humans have been described as "intense", including chases with dogs
	and generalist snares (Timmins <i>et al.</i>, 2008). There are fears that
	the saola may be snared into extinction (particularly in Viet Nam) due to
	a variety of more abundant wildlife species, such as wild pigs and civets
	(Timmins <i>et al.</i>, 2008). In addition to eating the meat, villagers
	may use the facial glands of the saola for medicinal purposes (Dung <i>et
	al.</i>, 1994). The saola is severely threatened by habitat destruction,
	with the forests within their range being cleared by timber extraction practices
	and for small-scale agricultural use. The creation of roads for logging trucks
	not only increases the among of lumber which can be exported, but also fragments
	the remaining forest patches and make these animals more accessible to hunters
	(Timmins <i>et al.</i>, 2008).
	</p><p>
	As of 1998, thirteen saola were known to have been captured and kept in
	captivity, and none survived longer than five months (Timmins <i>et al.</i>,
	2008 report at least 20 captive individuals, all of which met a similar fate,
	save for two that were released back into the wild). In light of this mortality,
	the Ministry of Forestry in Viet Nam has issued a ban on further capture,
	trade, or holding of saola; the Ministry has also ordered that no financial
	compensation be paid to anyone found in possession of a saola (Robichaud,
	1998).

	The saola is generally considered to be the greatest animal discovery in
	recent times, and is so different from any currently known species that a
	separate genus was constructed for it. The first record of this species came
	to the western world in the form of three sets of horns discovered in 1992
	in the Vu Quang Nature Reserve, from which the saola takes its alternate
	common name, the Vu Quang ox (Schaller and Rabinowitz, 1995). Very few saola
	have been studied alive, and much of our present knowledge comes from skeletons
	and tales from native villagers.
	<p align="Left">
	The common name "saola" [rhyming with "now, ha", and sometimes spelled "sao
	la"] is a native Lao name meaning "spinning-wheel posts", referring to the
	long, straight horns characteristic of this species (Robichaud, 1998). Similarly,
	the genus name <i>Pseudoryx</i> is based on the antelope genus
	<i><a href="http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Ungulates.html#Oryx">Oryx</a></i>, whose members (the oryxes)
	have extremely long, straight horns similar to those of the saola, and the
	Greek word <i>pseudes</i>, meaning false. The species name
	<i>nghetinhensis</i> describes the range of this new species: <b>Nghe an</b>
	and <b>Ha tinh</b> are two Vietnamese provinces (bordering on Lao People's
	Democratic Republic) in the core of the saola's range, with -<i>ensis</i>
	(Latin) being a suffix meaning "belonging to" (Dung <i>et al.</i>, 1993).
